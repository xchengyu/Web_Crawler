# Web_Crawler
Simple web crawler

1. Objective

I work with a simple web crawler to measure aspects of a crawl, study the
characteristics of the crawl, download web pages from the crawl and gather webpage metadata, all
from pre-selected news websites.
2. Preliminaries

To begin I will make use of an existing open source Java web crawler called crawler4j. This
crawler is built upon the open source crawler4j library which is located on github. For complete
details on downloading and compiling see
https://github.com/yasserg/crawler4j
Also see the following document for help installing Eclipse and crawler4j
